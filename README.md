# Where's That Ah

_Where's That Ah_ is a game inspired by [GeoGuessr](https://www.geoguessr.com/) that tests and improves your geographical knowledge of places around Singapore. It's deployed. I built this front-end web app as [Project 1](https://bootcamp.rocketacademy.co/1-frontend/1.p-frontend-app) for the [Rocket Academy Coding Bootcamp](https://www.rocketacademy.co/courses/coding-bootcamp).

## Usage

1. **Customise game settings**: Choose which type of places and how many places you'd like to guess.
2. **Start the game**: Click on the "Start" button.
3. **Guess the location**: You'll see a place name. Drop a pin on the Singapore map where you think the place is located.
4. **Submit your guess**: Click on the "Guess" button to confirm your pin location.
5. **See your score**: The closer your pin to the actual location, the higher your score. You'll see your total score after 5 rounds.
